# CappyDocCS
A tool to streamline documentation writing

Since I learned how to use Git, I am bringing my projects to GitHub for the sake of preservation and documentation.
I don't remember exactly when I started working on this, but it's a codebase I inherited from my dad.
I probably started in around September-October of 2019. This codebase is very messy, but it gets the job done.
